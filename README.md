# DotHrb Intro

# Leverage Your Existing Code

**DotHrb** enables you to leverage your existing Harbour code as the backend for new web interfaces. It provides a clean way to integrate your existing systems with modern front-end technologies, allowing you to enhance the user experience and extend the functionality of your applications. By utilizing **DotHrb**, you can bridge the gap between your existing codebase and contemporary web or mobile interfaces, facilitating the reuse of valuable assets while adapting to evolving technological requirements.

# Universal UI

**DotHrb** promotes the use of **Progressive Web Apps** (PWAs) as a **universal user interface** (UI). This approach allows a single codebase to run seamlessly on smartphones, tablets, desktops, and any device with a browser, eliminating the need for separate native apps for each platform. PWAs offer a consistent, app-like experience by leveraging modern web technologies like service workers for offline functionality and push notifications. The result is a highly adaptable and efficient solution that reduces development and maintenance costs while providing a uniform and high-quality user experience across all devices. This strategy unifies the UI, ensuring a consistent brand identity and functional design, whether the user is on a mobile phone or a desktop computer.

# Easy to Use & Customize

In development mode, **DotHrb** offers the convenience of on-the-fly source processing. This means you can simply select one of the pre-existing templates and begin adding your own code without needing separate build steps. This streamlined workflow lets you focus on writing code and rapidly iterating on your application without the hassle of manual tasks.
By eliminating these extra steps, **DotHrb** accelerates your development process, enabling you to quickly prototype, test, and refine your code within the chosen template. This makes it easier to bring your ideas to life efficiently.
